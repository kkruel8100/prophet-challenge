### Welcome to Kim's Prophet Challenge

where we use Google search trends and Mercado stock prices to analyze data.

#### Overview

Showcasing Pandas, Python, and Prophet, the challenge gathers data from public csv files. It slices, groups, and compares the data using visuals to identify trends. Prophet is used to create a model and forecast data.

#### Program

Step 1:

Navigate to the "forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb" file in GitHub repo. The output for each panel can be viewed in the "Preview" panel.

Alternatively,

Step 1:

Clone the repository.

Step 2:

Open "forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb"

Step 3:

Determine your environment.

- Note: The first panel installs prophet. If the environment is Google Colab, running this panel will be required. If the environment is local and already has prophet installed, then this panel can be skipped.

Step 4:

Run remaining panels.
